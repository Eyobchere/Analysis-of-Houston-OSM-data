# Analysis of Houston open street map (OSM) data

OpenStreetMap (OSM) is a collaborative project to create a free editable map of the world. The creation and growth of OSM has been motivated by restrictions on use or availability of map information across much of the world, and the advent of inexpensive portable satellite navigation devices (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenStreetMap). As OpenStreetMap is a free editable map of the world created by volunteers, there is a long debate on the quality and validity of the data provided by OpenStreetMap. Here I, analyzed Houston OpenStreetMap (OSM) data using data munging techniques to assess the quality of the data for validity, accuracy, completeness, consistency and uniformity.
